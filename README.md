# encryptedDiary
Summary: Used to encrypt personal content using terminal (have tested it only on Ubuntu only).

Description
I use this script to mainly encrypt private stuff. Its just a simple utility script which takes the file to be encrypted, what to call the ecrypted file, and what to do (i.e encrypt or decrypt) as its arguments. An advantage of its simplicity is that it can take different passwords for it encrypting different files. This script is only tested for individual files and not for a directory.
The code is pretty simple, just a couple of lines, googled most of the stuff and combined it based on what i needed, will find most of the stuff online.
